# Our Mission, Vision, and Values

## Our Mission

At Ayllu Academy, our mission is to employ new technologies and paradigms to boost the technological and educational development in Latin America. We do not seek to commoditize, or monetize education; but instead to give its value and power back to the users that participate of the educational process.

## Our Vision

Our vision is not only to become a widely used open source educational platform in Latin America, but also a repertoire of open source blockchain tooling that drives educational impact in many regions of the world.
