# Our Mission, Vision, and Values

## <mark style="color:red;">Our Mission</mark>

At Ayllu Academy, our mission is to employ new technologies and paradigms to boost the technological and educational development in Latin America. We do not seek to commoditize, or monetize education; but instead to give its value and power back to the users that participate of the educational process.

## <mark style="color:red;">Our Vision</mark>

Our vision is not only to become a widely used open source educational platform in Latin America, but also a repertoire of open source blockchain tooling that drives educational impact in many regions of the world.

### Value Constructive Conflict

Constructive conflict can arise when there is a form of respectful friction or disagreement within a team due to opposing ideas, values, or opinions. We strongly believe one must lean to listen and not be afraid to challenge proposed ideas. When managed correctly, constructive conflict leads to intellectual debates, innovative thinking, and better decision making.&#x20;

### Inspire the World

Live your day trying to positively inspire those around you, keeping yourself grounded to reality, and with a clear moral compass.

### Communicate Your Ideas

Don't be afraid to voice your thoughts! Everyone processes thoughts differently, and that makes everyone's thoughts valuable. We value and respect open ideation.

### Transform Existing Paradigms

In order to innovate we must often think outside the box and not be afraid of change. Always challenge existing paradigms and feel free to explore better ways of solving problems.&#x20;

### Optimize Your Work

Whenever possible we must aim to solve issues and develop tools in the most optimal way we can; our future selves will thank us.

### Respect Our Diversity

We have a diverse team that expands through many borders. Our diversity makes us stronger and we must always be respectful of one another.

### Iterate Ideas Fast

When building or ideating, we must move as fast as we can through their iterative processes. Don't let thoughts or solutions lose their momentum.

### Aspire to Become Someone of Value, not Just Success

When asked for guidance in life, Albert Einstein responded "...**Try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value." .** That could not resonate any better with us.
