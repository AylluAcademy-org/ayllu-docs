Note: This section is based on Github Docs, as a lot of its content is relevant and applicable to our open source project.

# Types of contributions :memo:
You can contribute to the project in several ways. This repo is a place to discuss and collaborate on the documentation relevant to the project! Our tiny, but mighty docs team :mechanical_arm: is maintaining this repo. To preserve our bandwidth, off topic conversations will be closed.

### :mega: Discussions
Discussions are where we have conversations.

If you'd like help troubleshooting a docs PR you're working on, have a great new idea, or want to share something amazing you've learned in our docs, join us in our development communication server at: **COMING SOON**

### :lady_beetle: Issues
[Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. If an issue has a triage label, we haven't reviewed it yet, and you shouldn't begin work on it.

If you've found something in the documentation that should get updated, or found a problem in any of the repositories, please search open issues of the respective repository to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using a template within the repo, and we'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Pull requests
A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) is a way to suggest changes in our repository. When we merge those changes, they should get updated in the corresponding repo's main branch within 24 hours. :earth_africa:

### :question: Support
We are a very small team working hard to keep up with the documentation, and project demands of a continuously changing product. Unfortunately, at times we might be a bit slow at reviewing, documenting, updating code, and/or merging PRs. Please forgive us in advance for little delays; but know we will do everything possible to get things in order as soon as possible

### :earth_asia: Espa√±ol

We are well aware the nature of our project is geared towards Spanish Speaking regions, however, the code itself is not limited to only those regions and we hope it can get used worldwide in many different applications; with that in mind, we believe is best to keep the code, and documentation primarily in English to facilitate world wide collaboration. It's worth mentioning we will be including Spanish translations of the documentation in the future. 

**We do not currently accept contributions for translated content**, but we hope to in the future.
