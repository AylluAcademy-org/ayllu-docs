# How it Works

Ayllu Academy seeks to develop an open source eLearning platform that employs a new Learn to Earn mechanic to incentivize participation and education. We will achieve this by making use of blockchain technologies to facilitate digital value exchange, transparency, and most importantly, cooperativism among participants.

The way the mechanics will work is by employing the following features:

1. A native token Mint and Reserve
2. Closed micro economy
3. Token distribution to participants, based on pre-defined variables
4. Variable token valuation (Exchange Rate)
5. Pre-set redeeming periods

Our code is segmented into different repositories for better management and organization. In this GitBook we will include sections for each repository describing their functionalities.&#x20;
